## Deploy your own instance of Fresco

**1. Use the Vercel deploy button to configure your project's deployment in Vercel.**

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcomplexdatacollective%2Ffresco-setup-flow-test&env=DATABASE_URL,NEXTAUTH_SECRET,NEXTAUTH_URL,UPLOADTHING_SECRET,UPLOADTHING_APP_ID&envDescription=Environment%20variable%20documentation&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcomplexdatacollective%2Ffresco-setup-flow-test&project-name=fresco&repository-name=fresco&demo-title=Fresco&demo-description=Bringing%20Network%20Canvas%20interviews%20to%20the%20web%20browser&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fnetworkcanvas.com%2F&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fframerusercontent.com%2Fimages%2FUvNFzJTlj8T2Tn8zWSNGpnrkOI.svg)

**2. Create Git Repository**

Follow instructions to create a git repository to deploy from. This will contain a cloned version of this repo.

**3. Configure Project**

Provide required environment variables:

| Variable    | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| DATABASE_URL  | [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)   |
| NEXTAUTH_SECRET | generate a new secret on the command line with `openssl rand -base64 32`    |
| NEXTAUTH_URL    | URL to your app    |
| UPLOADTHING_SECRET | Create a project on [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com/) and copy the generated API keys.  |
| UPLOADTHING_APP_ID    |   |

**4. Deploy**

Click "Deploy" and wait for the deployment to finish

**5. Create User Account**

Visit your deployed app to create your administrator account. Only one user account may be created.

**Note: For security, you have _five minutes_ from when the app is deployed to create the user account. If this time elapses without a user account created, your configuration will expire. You may redeploy using the same steps.**
